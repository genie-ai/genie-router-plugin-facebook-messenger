A genie-router plugin that enables the use of Facebook Messenger as a client.

# Configuration

## SSL

Facebook requires that your genie-router instance listens on a https URL. There are plenty
of methods to achieve this, but here are two options:

1. Use a proxy tool like [_ngrok_](https://ngrok.io) or [_localtunnel_](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel) to
get a public endpoint that supports https
2. Setup an [_apache_](http://www.apachetutor.org/admin/reverseproxies) or
[nginx](https://www.keycdn.com/support/nginx-reverse-proxy/) webserver that will act as a
[_reverse proxy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy). You can use [_letsencrypt_](https://letsencrypt.org/)
to configure a URL with https/ssl.

## Facebook

First, make sure that your genie-router installation has the `http` module enabled
and is accessible via https (facebook requires this for webhooks). One option is
to place genie-router behind a webserver (apache or nginx) via a reverse proxy. This way,
the SSL/HTTPS is handled by the webserver.

Then, follow the [Getting Started](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started/app-setup)
guide to create your App and Page. Remember what you configure as the verifyToken.

Check `messages` as the webhook subscription.

## genie-router

This plugin needs to be configured in the `plugins` section of _genie-router_. There are
three properties that can be configured.

- accessToken, the pageAccessToken generated by Facebook when configuring the FB app
- verifyToken, the verifyToken you configured for the webhook
- password, an optional configuration parameter, that requires users to identify themselves
with a password before they can send text to genie-router.

## Example config

```
{
  "plugins": {
    "facebook-messenger": {
        "verifyToken": "genierouter",
        "accessToken": "xxx",
        "password": "secure-4-me"
    }
  }
}
```
